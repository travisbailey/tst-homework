# TST Homework
My stab at a solution for the homework assignment provided by PDF.

## Prerequisites
1. Java 1.8 or better
1. sbt 1.3.13 (may work with others)
1. git to clone repo

## Steps to validate tests
1. in console, cd to root of project
1. sbt test

## Notes
- This is clearly a complicated problem. My solution is really only effective for small sample sizes.
- This is a Play Framework template started code base... I didn't remove the boilerplate as I really just wanted to have a basic sandbox to play in.
